// The original LiamBindle code included socket based ethernet interfaces to
// a Linux-or-Apple like OS, OR to a Microsoft like OS. In this application
// we are bare metal (no OS) and the ethernet interface is a ENC28J60 device
// which communicates via a SPI interface.
//
// The ENC28J60 can receive and buffer data from the Ethernet. And the
// ENC28J60 can buffer transmit data that will go to the Ethernet. But without
// an OS this bare metal application is single threaded and can only be doing
// one thing at a time ... receiving or transmitting or other application
// tasks.
//
// The web server application I'm starting with has the notion of being the
// entity that responds to incoming traffic. For instance, a browser sends a
// request to the web server, and the web server replies to the request. This
// is a one-for-one exchange. While it is possible for the browser to send
// another request before the first response is sent from the web server this
// is unlikely to happen, but if it does the ENC28J60 will buffer the new
// requests until they can be processed.
//
// In a MQTT application traffic is more asynchronous. Rather than a browser
// sourcing incoming traffic there is a "broker". And the application can
// send traffic to a broker asynchronously based on some stimulus in the
// application (the stimulus perhaps being a sense input change). Likewise the
// broker can send traffic to the application asynchronously (perhaps a relay
// state change command). The broker might send a whole series of asynchronous
// relay state change commands while the application is trying to send a whole
// series of sense input changes.
//
// The web server application uses a single receive/transmit buffer since it
// does not expect to receive numerous incoming browser requests while trying
// to send numerous outgoing responses. Although I suppose it can handle that,
// I haven't tested it that way because the application is a simple relay
// controller / sense input reporter. And I believe the ENC28J60 will buffer
// incoming traffic until the application can come around to receiving it, as
// long as the application doesn't take too long to get to it (causing an
// ENC28J60 buffer over-run).
//
// I suppose the same Ethernet processing concepts can be applied to the MQTT
// application. We'll let the ENC28J60 buffer the asynchronous incoming
// commands until we can get around to individually reading and processing
// them. And we'll send trasnmit data via the ENC28J60 whenever we have any.
// There are a few additional decisions to make:
//
// - Processing received MQTT commands should probably have precedence over
//   transmitting sense data. So our "main loop" should check for incoming
//   data first and do what needs to be done. This is similar to the existing
//   main loop that processes browser data.
//
// - The existing "main loop" only expects to send a browser response if a
//   browser command was received. This will have to be altered so that any
//   asynchronous MQTT transmit request can be sent to the broker.
//
// - The existing web server uses a single buffer for all incoming and
//   outgoing HTTP traffic. The MQTT code wants to use separate incoming and
//   outgoing buffers. Part of the reason for this is that the MQTT code uses
//   its transmit buffer to store BOTH the transmit queue information as well
//   as the transmit data itself. It is in the form of |QUEUE_INFO1|DATA1|
//   QUEUE_INFO2|DATA2|etc. It looks like we can share the receive buffer with
//   browser traffic, but the transmit buffers must be separate ... until a
//   MQTT transmit has to happen. Then buffered MQTT transmit data needs to
//   be copied to the uip_buf and the UIP code needs to be signaled to do the
//   actual transmission.
//
// - How will the main loop determine the difference between browser HTML
//   traffic and MQTT traffic? It can be differentiated based on the Port
//   Number (one for HTTP and one for MQTT).
//
// - There might also be the need to only allow
//   browser traffic for initial setup of the application, THEN only allow
//   MQTT traffic after that, perhaps until the device is reset and returns
//   to a "setup" mode. This would be similar to the way Smart Home devices
//   work. But it might be better to allow browser based setup traffic at
//   any time, if for no other reason than to check on operation of the
//   application should MQTT seem to have stopped working. I will take the
//   "always allow the browser to work" approach first and see how that works
//   out.

  // This function will copy MQTT data to the uip_buf for transmission to the
  // MQTT Server.
  // The return value is the number of bytes sent.
  // There is only one call to this function. It is in the mqtt.c file.
  //
  // We will use the UIP functions to actually transmit the data. To do this
  // we copy the transmit data from the mqtt_sendbuf to the uip_buf. From the
  // perspective of the MQTT code this copy action means "sent" even though
  // the UIP transmit code still needs to execute (remember we are single
  // threaded). After we return from this function the MQTT code will return to
  // the main.c loop, and that is where the UIP code will transmit the data
  // that we just put in the uip_buf.
  //
  // If the MQTT code queues up more than one message to send the uip_periodic
  // function (called during the main.c loop) will scan all the connections
  // every 100ms and will perform another mqtt_sync to transmit anything that
  // is pending.
  // 
  // A connection is initially established in the main.c loop with the
  // "mqtt_start" steps. Those steps cause the following to occur:
  //  a) If a non-zero MQTT Server IP Address is found an ARP request is sent
  //     to the MQTT Server to determine its MAC address.
  //  b) A TCP connection request is sent to the MQTT Server. This will add
  //     the connection to the connections table for subsequent use.
  //  After a) and b) are done the UIP code is able to build IP and TCP
  //  headers when a transmit is requested for a given connection.
  //
  // A transmit is requested when we leave this function because of how we got
  // here. We arrived in the MQTT code because of a UIP_APPCALL. When we
  // return from that UIP_APPCALL data will be transmitted if uip_slen is
  // greater than zero.
  //

  /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  // Two types of MQTT transmissions are handled here. One is the normal
  // MQTT packet. The other is an Auto Discovery packet. Because the MQTT
  // packet buffer is very small in this application it cannot hold an entire
  // Auto Discovery packet. So this function checks to determine if the
  // application is trying to send an Auto Discovery packet. If yes, the
  // function will generate the Auto Discovery packet here. If no, it is
  // assummed that the packet was generated external to this function and
  // is already present in the MQTT transmit buffer.
  //
  // For Auto Discovery Publish messages main.c needs to create a publish
  // message like the following. It includes a message placeholder and the
  // length of that placeholder.
  // 
  // This message triggers an Output discovery message. "xx" is the output
